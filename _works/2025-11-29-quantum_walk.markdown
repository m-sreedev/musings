## Toss a coin if you're drunk

Dr.Reif had a long week and like any sensible academic, he has decided to spend the night having a few drinks at the local bar. But unfortunately, he had a drink or two too much and is now standing under a lamp in the parking lot looking for his car (ehm, or looking for the Uber since he's sensible).

Since Dr.Reif is in the mood for some fun, he decides to walk with a rule. (why not?)
- Before taking a step, toss a coin.
- If it's heads, take a step left.
- If it's tails, take a step right.

If old Rief takes a very large number of steps like these, where do you think he's most likely to end up?

Ans : He's most likely to end up at the lamp post, from where he started.
(Dr.Reif hereby pemits you to get drunk if you got this right.)

What Reif performed is known as a **Classical Random Walk**. Given below is the probability vs final position for Dr. Reif :
